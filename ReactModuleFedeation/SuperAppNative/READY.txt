✅ FIXED AND READY!

Removed expo-router plugin (not needed - we use React Navigation)

Services Status:
✅ Todo Metro: Port 8081
✅ Weather Metro: Port 8082
⏳ Expo: Starting on port 8083...

To see Expo QR code, open a new terminal and run:
cd SuperAppNative
npx expo start

Or wait 10 more seconds for the background process to finish loading.

Once you see the QR code:
1. Open Expo Go app on your phone
2. Scan the QR code
3. App should load (SDK 54 compatible!)
4. Tap "Todo" or "Weather" to see Module Federation in action!
